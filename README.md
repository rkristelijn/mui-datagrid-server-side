# MUI Datagrid Server Side

> this is a work in progress project, once completed a blog will be written about it

Objective:

Create an app that works together with the MUI datagrid, but all the sorting, pagination, filtering (column selection and ordering, detail page on selection, new record, delete record, inline edites, record edit collisions fix with rownum) are done server side. 

Things used:

- NextJS
- MUI
- json-server as a backend (not the beta version as it doesn't have middleware)

## local dev

- `npm run server` - start the REST server
- `npm start` - start the frontend

## Sources

- [Data Grid - Server-side data](https://mui.com/x/react-data-grid/server-side-data/)
